# Teact

**Teact** is a lightweight and super-performant web framework with zero dependencies implementing React paradigm.

It was originally developed as part of **Telegram JavaScript contest** and now powers the official [**Telegram Web**](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt) client. This repo is an extracted version of the framework.

**Demo:** https://ajaxy.github.io/teact/demo

### TODO

Anyone is welcome to contribute.

- Support packaging as a library, add **npm** support with usage examples.
- Add unit tests.
- Consider separating Teact and TeactN.
- Consider extracting `useHeaveAnimationCheck`.
